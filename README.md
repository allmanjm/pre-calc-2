# PreCalcSkills2

This is a bank of randomized exercises for the CheckIt platform. The exercises align with 13 learning outcomes for specific precalculus skills which, in the opinion of the bank's author, are "must have" skills for doing single-variable calculus (necessary but not sufficient).

The exercises were developed originally for the second semester of a year-long "Calculus I with Integrated Precalculus" sequence at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC [<https://math.wfu.edu/>]. Exercises corresponding to the first semester of the sequence (which covers the precalculus and differential calculus of algebraic functions) can be found in companion PreCalcSkills1 bank: <https://allmanjm.github.io/pre-calc-1/>

The learning outcomes in this *Precalculus Skills 2* bank directly support the *calculus* learning outcomes in the "Stretch Calculus Part 2" bank found at the links below:

## Learning Outcomes for Precalculus Skills 2

###### PDst. Distance in the plane. 
I can use the Pythagorean Theorem to compute distances in the plane.

###### PCE. Circles and equations.
I can write an equation for a circle with a given center and radius. Conversely, I can identify the center and radius from an equation which defines a circle.

###### PTUC. Trigonometry and the unit circle.
I can use the unit circle to compute values of trigonometric functions.

###### PTRT. Trigonometry in right triangles.
I can compute lengths of sides and measures of angles using trigonometry in right triangles.

###### PTI1. Trigonometric Identities 1.
I can manipulate and/or simplify expressions involving the "Pythagorean" and "angle-sum" trigonometric identities.

###### PTI2. Trigonometric Identities 2.
I can manipulate and simplify expressions involving the "double-angle" and "half-angle" (aka "power reduction") trigonometric identities.

###### PLR. Logarithm Rules.
I can use "logarithm rules" to manipulate and simplify expressions involving logarithms.

###### PGSC. Basic Graphs: sines and cosines.
I can sketch basic graphs of the sine and cosine functions.

###### PGLE. Basic Graphs: logarithms and exponentials.
I can sketch basic graphs of exponential functions and logarithms.

###### PGTA. Basic Graphs: tangents and arctangents.
I can sketch basic graphs of the tangent and arctangent functions.

###### PTSC. Analyzing transcendental functions.
I can determine when a transcendental function is zero or undefined and make a sign chart.

###### PST. Similar Triangles.
I can use triangle similarity to compute lengths in the plane.

###### PSy1.1. Synthesis 1.1.
I can manipulate expressions and solve equations by successively performing multiple algebraic steps.
